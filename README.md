# OS-Based Algorithm Visualiser
This project is a comprehensive visualizer for key Operating System algorithms, including CPU Scheduling, Page Replacement, Memory Management, and Disk Scheduling.
It provides a clear, interactive, and animated representation of how these algorithms work — perfect for educational use and classroom demonstrations.

## Features

#### 🔄 CPU Scheduling Algorithms
FCFS, SJF, SRTF, Priority (Preemptive & Non-Preemptive), Round Robin, Multilevel Queue, Multilevel Feedback Queue.

#### 💾 Memory Management
First Fit, Best Fit, Worst Fit allocation visualizations.

#### 📄 Page Replacement Algorithms
FIFO, LRU, Optimal, Second Chance.

#### 💽 Disk Scheduling Algorithms
